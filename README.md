3D segmentation, intensity and distance measurements

// InDis3.ijm
// 
// This script proceeds with the segmentation of 3D cells in brain sections using the Trainable Weka tool provided by FiJi.
// A classifier needs to be produced prior using the script.
// The segmentented objects as well as the brain section contour are stored for further analysis: 3D measurements from cell center to brain section contour, Integrated density 
// within and in the vicinity of cells.
